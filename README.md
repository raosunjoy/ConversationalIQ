- **Integration Strategy**: Zendesk-native marketplace application  
- **Business Model**: SaaS subscription with tiered pricing
- **Exit Strategy**: Acquisition by Zendesk within 2-3 years
- **Target Valuation**: $50-100M based on $10-20M ARR

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka
- **AI/ML**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenAI GPT-4, Hugging Face
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, MSK)
- **Integration**: Native Zendesk App Framework

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raosunjoy/ConversationalIQ.git
cd ConversationalIQ
npm install
```

2. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

3. **Start Development Environment**
```bash
# Start all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Run the application
npm run dev
```

4. **Verify Setup**
```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run pre-commit
```

## 🧪 Development Standards

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**MANDATORY**: All development follows strict TDD methodology:
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve while keeping tests green

### Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)
- ✅ **100% Test Coverage** 
- ✅ **100% Test Pass Rate**
- ✅ **Zero TypeScript Errors** (strict mode)
- ✅ **Zero Lint Errors**

### Required Commands
```bash
# Before any development
npm run build && npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run test

# During development (TDD cycle)  
npm run test:watch

# Before committing
npm run pre-commit
```
