## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Sentiment Analysis Seems Incorrect

**Symptoms**: Sentiment reading doesn't match your assessment of the customer's mood

**Solutions**:
1. Check message context - sometimes sarcasm or complex language can confuse the AI
2. Look at confidence score - low confidence readings should be taken with caution
3. Consider cultural/linguistic differences that might affect analysis
4. Use the feedback system to report consistently incorrect readings

#### No Response Suggestions Appearing

**Symptoms**: Suggestion panel is empty or showing generic responses

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you have sufficient conversation context (minimum 2-3 customer messages)
2. Check your internet connection - suggestions require real-time processing
3. Verify the customer issue type is supported (most are, but some very specific technical issues may have limited suggestions)
4. Refresh the app if suggestions haven't appeared within 10 seconds

#### Escalation Alerts Not Working

**Symptoms**: No alerts appearing for obviously frustrated customers

**Solutions**:
1. Verify escalation prevention is enabled in your settings
2. Check that the customer's messages are being properly processed (sentiment should be showing)
3. Some customers express frustration in subtle ways - the AI may not detect low-level dissatisfaction
4. Report persistent issues to your administrator

#### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: App loading slowly or suggestions delayed

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection speed (minimum 10 Mbps recommended)
2. Close unnecessary browser tabs to free up memory
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try using a different browser
5. Contact IT support if issues persist
